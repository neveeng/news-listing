# Switch Front-end Developer Exercise

## News Listing

As a Content Editor I want news articles to display in a structured list so site users can easily view and consume news content.

## Starting Application

Install dependencies and run it.

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
